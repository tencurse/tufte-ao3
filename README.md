# Tufte AO3
Stylus stylesheet for Archive of our own, inspired by and based on [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)

This stylesheet only modifies the workskin and nothing else.

## Preview

## Notes
Download Linux Libertine font here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine/

There's a selection of serif fonts available in the code, just edit the variable `--font-family`. You may add your own through Google fonts or other CDN!

This style conflicts with userscript: **AO3: Fic's Style, Blacklist, Bookmarks**
- Simply disable the _Styling_ feature and this should work
